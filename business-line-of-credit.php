                            <p>A business line of credit gives businesses access to cash on an as-needed basis, up to a predetermined limit. Unlike a traditional small business loan, there isn’t a lump-sum disbursement with a line of credit. As a result, this form of financing allows businesses to fund ongoing or unexpected expenses.</p>
                            <p>Typically, business lines of credit are unsecured, which means that there isn’t any collateral required to qualify for this form of financing.</p>

                            <p style="color: #fff;">We reviewed 16 popular lenders based on 16 data points in the categories of loan details, loan costs, eligibility and accessibility, customer experience and the application process. We chose the best lenders based on the weighting assigned to each category:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li style="color: #fff;margin-top: 15px;">Loan cost. 35%</li>
                                <li style="color: #fff;margin-top: 15px;">Loan details. 25%</li>
                                <li style="color: #fff;margin-top: 15px;">Customer experience. 20%</li>
                                <li style="color: #fff;margin-top: 15px;">Eligibility and accessibility. 10%</li>
                                <li style="color: #fff;margin-top: 15px;">Application process. 10%</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p style="color: #fff;">Within each major category, we also considered several characteristics, including available loan amounts, repayment terms and applicable fees. We also looked at minimum credit score and time in business requirements and the geographic availability of the lender. Finally, we evaluated each provider’s customer support tools, borrower perks and features that simplify the borrowing process—like online applications, prequalification options and mobile apps.</p>
                            <p style="color: #fff;">Where appropriate, we awarded partial points depending on how well a lender met each criterion.</p>

                            </div>
                            <p>When you get a business line of credit, you’ll receive a credit limit you can borrow against in the future. Instead of receiving the full amount upfront, as in the case of a business loan, borrowers get the ability to withdraw what they need over time, known as the draw period.</p>
                            <p>Unlike a traditional business loan, borrowers are only responsible for paying interest on the amount they borrow—not the total credit limit. After the draw period, which typically lasts 12 to 24 months but can sometimes go up to five years, the repayment period starts and the borrower can no longer withdraw funds. The borrower must pay off the outstanding balance and any interest by a fixed date, which can range anywhere from six months to five years.</p>

                            <p>A business line of credit is a flexible form of financing that allows business owners to borrow money as needed, rather than receiving funds as a lump-sum payment such as with a small business loan. Instead of paying interest on the entire credit line, borrowers owe interest only on the funds they use.</p>   
                            <p>There are two types of business lines of credit:</p>

                            <p>A secured business line of credit requires you to pledge collateral—which is something of value, like accounts receivable or inventory—that a lender can seize if you fail to repay what you borrow.</p>    
                            <p>Qualifying for a secured line of credit can be easier and may have lower interest rates than an unsecured line of credit. Nonetheless, before opting for this type of line of credit, be sure you can afford to repay any debt you take on.</p>

                            <p>An unsecured business line of credit doesn’t require you to pledge collateral. However, a lender may require a personal guarantee, which means you accept personal responsibility for repaying the loan if the business is unable to make payments. This could affect your personal credit, too.</p>   
                            <p>Unsecured lines of credit can have higher interest rates and may have stricter requirements than secured lines of credit, but it won’t carry the same consequences if you default.</p>
