                            </div>
                            <p>A conduit loan, also known as a CMBS loan, is a commercial real estate loan which is secured by a mortgage on a commercial property. These loans are structured by conduit lenders, commercial banks or investment banks.</p>
                            <p>A conduit loan consists of commercial real estate first mortgage debt, which is pooled together and held in a trust. The commercial loans are single loans of varying property types, loan sizes, and locations. The trust then releases a series of bonds of varying yield, duration, and payment priority. Investors choose which bond they would like to purchase based on their appetite for risk, yield, and duration.</p>
                            <p>Commercial real estate first mortgage debt is generally broken down into two basic categories: (1) loans to be securitized (“CMBS loans”) and (2) portfolio loans. Portfolio loans are originated by a leader and held on its balance sheet through maturity. In a CMBS transaction, many single mortgage loans of varying size, property type and location are pooled and transferred to a trust. The trust issues a series of bonds that may vary in yield, duration and payment priority. Nationally recognized rating agencies then assign credit ratings to the various bond classes ranging from investment grade (AAA/Aaa through BBB-/Baa3) to below investment grade (BB+/Ba1 through B-/B3) and an unrated class which is subordinate to the lowest rated bond class.</p>
