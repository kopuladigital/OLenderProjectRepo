                            <p style="color: #fff;">The commercial mortgage and real estate group offers the combination of long-term, fixed-rate financing and a user-friendly delivery process. Our interest rates are competitive, but most of our success is because of our process in committing, closing and servicing loans. We pride ourselves in being a fair, honest, open and flexible source of real estate loans. In addition, our clients benefit by obtaining yield spreads above industry standards.</p>
                            <p style="color: #fff;">Our conservative management style emphasizes self-amortizing mortgages. This approach aligns the interests of the borrower with those of the client/lender. Return of, rather than simple return on, capital is paramount.</p>
                            <p style="color: #fff;">Over the past seven years, we’ve originated more than $2.1 billion in commercial mortgages for our clients. These investments are secured by office buildings, warehouses, apartment communities, hotels and retail centers located throughout the United States. This strategy of diversification produces a well-balanced portfolio designed to be resistant to economic and real estate risks.</p>

                            </div>
                            <p>At approximately $5.2 trillion, just over half the size of the U.S. corporate bond market, the U.S. commercial mortgage market is home to a variety of attractive investment opportunities.1 Commercial banks and life insurance companies hold the majority of U.S. private commercial mortgages. In the past, the substantial organizational infrastructure required to access and underwrite them has limited institutional investors’ ability to invest in this asset class. Today, new commercial mortgage investment vehicles are emerging every year, and the asset class is becoming more accessible to a broader range of investors. Also, as financial institutions become more familiar with the asset class, more options for leveraging commercial mortgage loan (CML) investments are becoming available. We believe this increased accessibility and familiarity has emerged at an opportune time, as many institutional investors, from public and private pension funds to foundations and endowments, remain under-allocated to the sector and are seeking income-oriented strategies.</p>
