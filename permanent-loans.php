                            <p>A permanent loan is defined as a first mortgage on a piece of commercial property that has some amortization and a term of at least five years.  Most commercial permanent loans are amortized over 25 years.  If the property is older than 30-years-old and/or showing signs of wear and tear, many banks will insist on amortizing their commercial permanent loans over just 20 years.</p>

                            <p style="color: #fff;">The term "permanent loan" can be confusing because its meaning can differ greatly depending on the context. For example, in the fine art market, permanent loans are arrangements in which the donor of an artwork agrees to lend it to an art gallery or museum for an extended period of time.</p>
                            <p style="color: #fff;">Permanent loans in this context are alternatives to an outright gift or donation. Yet although the term "loan" typically implies a financial motive, permanent loans in the art world generally do not involve any interest payments or other financial compensation. Instead, the donor will simply expect certain parameters to be followed by the receiving institution, such as agreeing on the duration of the loan and arranging that the donor will receive public recognition for the loaned artwork. Despite the word "permanent," these permanent loans are in fact temporary, with terms generally ranging between five to thirty years.</p>
                            <p style="color: #fff;">In the world of real estate, the term "permanent loan" is used to describe the mortgage loans secured by real estate developers after a given projected has been completed. These permanent mortgage loans generally replace the construction loan financing that the developer had relied upon in order to develop the building and prepare it for sale. Here again, although the term permanent is used, a more accurate description would be "long-term loan." The amortization periods on permanent real estate loans are typically in the 15- to 30-year range, with 25 years being a common example.</p>

                            <p>Construction-to-permanent financing funds the construction or renovation of your home and then automatically converts to a permanent mortgage loan after construction is finished. During the construction phase, your lender authorizes payments, or “draws,” to cover the cost of land, materials, labor, permits and other expenses. They work closely with an inspector to ensure the construction continues on schedule and on budget.</p>

                            <p>A construction-to-permanent loan can be used to purchase a home that needs renovating. These types of loans cover the sale price of the home, plus the cost of the home renovations, and are based on the home’s value after repairs and upgrades are completed. With this one-time close option, you eliminate the need for multiple loans to finance your home renovations. And it allows you to choose from a wider selection of properties during your home search, including fixer-uppers and homes listed in “as-is” condition.</p>
